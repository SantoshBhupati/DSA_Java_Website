            <h2>Following is the various Applications of Queue in Data Structure:</h2>
            <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
            <h4>1.Job Scheduling </h4>
            <p>The jobs that are to be executed by the computer is scheduled to be executed one by one. There are many jobs like keyboard press, mouse click etc. in the system.<br>

                These jobs are brought in the main memory. These jobs are assigned to the processor one by one which is organized using a queue.<br>
                
                e.g. First In First Out and Round Robin processor scheduling in queues.</p><br>
            <h4>2. Multiprogramming</h4>
            <p>If there are multiple programs in the main memory, then it is called multiprogramming. The various programs in the main memory are organized as queues and the queues formed are called ‘Ready Queue’.<br>
                The processors will execute the programs by accessing them from the cache memory. This is done for their simultaneous execution.</p><br>
            <h4>3.For Operation on Data Structure </h4>
            <p>Certain operations like ‘tree traversal’ and ‘Breadth first search uses queue for graph traversal’ involve the use of queues. These are some non-linear data structures. The sequence of traversal of inputs is set using queues.</p><br>
            <h4>4. Access to Shared Resources</h4>
            <p>In a networked system, the service is asked from a single resource simultaneously by various workstations or machines. The requests are generated in fractions of second, which is very fast.<br>
                Although there’s always some time difference in the requests generated. This situation is maintained by implementing a queue in the device at the server.</p><br>
                <h4>5.Multilevel Queue Scheduling</h4>
                <p>Here, the jobs are allocated and divided into multiple queues. Every process is assigned a unique priority based on which the system executes the processes.
   <br>
                    This system has one limitation which is the lower priority processes may be pre-empted by a higher priority process.</p><br>
                    <h4>6.As a Buffer Space</h4>
                    <p>It is used in network, during transmission of data from source machine to destination.</p>
