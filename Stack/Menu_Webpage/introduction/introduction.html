            <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
            <p><b>Stack </b>is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).</p>
            <img src="./img/introsidebox.png" alt="">
            <p>There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.</p><br>

                <h3>Some key points related to stack</h3>
                <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
1)It is called as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books, etc.<br>
2)A Stack is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store the elements of a limited size.<br>
3)It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that order can be LIFO or FILO.<br>

           <h4> Standard Stack Operations</h4>
           <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
The following are some common operations implemented on the stack:<br>

<b>push()</b>: When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.<br>
<b>pop()</b>: When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.<br>
<b>isEmpty()</b>: It determines whether the stack is empty or not.<br>
<b>isFull()</b>: It determines whether the stack is full or not.<br>
<b>peek()</b>: It returns the element at the given position.<br>
<b>count()</b>: It returns the total number of elements available in a stack.<br>
<b>change()</b>: It changes the element at the given position.<br>
<b>display()</b>: It prints all the elements available in the stack.<br></p>
