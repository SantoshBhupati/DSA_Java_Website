            <p>It was simple when we used to store just a couple of numbers, we just make some variables for that and store respectively. But what if we want to store 50 numbers? Ofcource, we can make 50 variables and store but that would be very childish approach and inappropriate. And now assume we have to 5000 numbers, we can't make just 5000 variables.<br><br>To handle this situation, in almost all programming languages we have a data structure called <b>Arrays.</b></p>

            <h2>What is an Array ?</h2>
            <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
            <p>An array is a data structure used to store a collection of data of the same data type. Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.<br><br>

                Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.<br><br>
                
                Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.</p>
