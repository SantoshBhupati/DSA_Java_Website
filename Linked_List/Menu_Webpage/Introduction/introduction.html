            <h2>Introduction To Linked List</h2>
            <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
             <p>A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.<br>
                Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of <b>Linked List.</b><br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Link</b> − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.<br>

<b>Next</b> − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.<br>

<b>LinkedList</b> − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.<br>

              
                </p> 
                <br>
                <br> 
    <h3>Linked List Representation</h3>
    <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
    <p>Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.</p>
    <br>

    <p>
        As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.<br>

1)Linked List contains a link element called Head<br>

2)Each link carries a data field and a link field called next.<br>

3)Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.<br>

4)Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Uses of Linked List</h3>
    <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
    <p>The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory.<br> The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list.<br> This achieves optimized utilization of space.<br>
        list size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.<br>
        Empty node can not be present in the linked list.<br>
        We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.<br>
        </p>
   <br>
      <h3>Why use linked list over array?
    </h3>
    <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
    <p>Array contains following limitations:
  <br>
        1)The size of array must be known in advance before using it in the program.<br>
        2)Increasing size of the array is a time taking process. It is almost impossible to expand the size of the array at run time.<br>
        3)All the elements in the array need to be contiguously stored in the memory. Inserting any element in the array needs shifting of all its predecessors.<br>
        <br>
        Linked list is the data structure which can overcome all the limitations of an array. Using linked list is useful because,<br>
        
         1)It allocates the memory dynamically. All the nodes of linked list are non-contiguously stored in the memory and linked together with the help of pointers.<br>
        2)Sizing is no longer a problem since we do not need to define its size at the time of declaration. List grows as per the program's demand and limited to the available memory space.<br></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Types of Linked List</h3>
        <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
        <p>Following are the various types of linked list.<br>

           <b> Singly Linked List</b> − Item navigation is forward only.<br>
            
          <b>  Doubly Linked List </b>− Items can be navigated forward and backward.<br>
            
           <b> Circular Linked List </b>− Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous<br></p><br>
           <h3>Basic Operations</h3>
           <hr class="common_horizonatl_line">
           <p>
            Following are the basic operations supported by a list.<br>

            <b>Insertion</b> − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.<br>
            
            <b>Deletion </b>− Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.<br>
            
           <b> Display</b> − Displays the complete list.<br>
            
           <b> Search </b>− Searches an element using the given key.<br>
            
          <b>  Delete </b>− Deletes an element using the given key.<br>
           </p>
